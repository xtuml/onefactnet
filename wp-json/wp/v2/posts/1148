Referential attributes lose prefix settings and attribute order changes. Examining the model data shows that the unique IDs of the attributes are different which means they are deleted and re-created.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will want to avoid this situation. If changing only the cardinality, I suggest you use the existing context menu entry for &#8216;Cardinality&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will keep issue 11703 updated as we progress to address this issue.<br>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt='bug-5702402' src='https:\/\/onefact.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/bug-5702402.jpeg' alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1147\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We develop software.
