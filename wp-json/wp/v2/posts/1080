The tool itself is a computer program with a purpose. \u00a0Even though it rides atop a <em>semantic<\/em> metamodel which is embodied in a pool of <em>technology<\/em>, the <em>application<\/em> is the personality\u00a0of the tool. \u00a0Good choices at the semantic and technology layers\u00a0can help but not guarantee that the application will behave and do its job well.<\/p>\n<p>Layers above depend upon layers below, however, there is significant independence layer to layer. \u00a0This independence allows changes to be made in one layer without affecting other layers. \u00a0This deserves further exploration and discussion in future posts.<\/p>\n<p>There is recursion and self-reference here. \u00a0Do not confuse the tool application with the application the tool is used to craft. \u00a0Enjoy the idea of modeling a modeling language with models. \u00a0And consider modeling your modeling tool with a modeling tool.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let us consider three layers to a modeling tool: application, semantic and technology.
