Prior versions ran on Eclipse Mars. The user experience is<br \/>\nnot dramatically different, but the update of course includes new features and fixes from the Eclipse<br \/>\nfoundation. Please see the article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/eclipse\/news\/4.7\/\">Eclipse Oxygen &#8211; New and Noteworthy<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n<p>This update includes an update to Eclipse EGit 4.9. See the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.eclipse.org\/EGit\/New_and_Noteworthy\">EGit &#8211; New and Noteworthy<\/a><br \/>\nfor details about updates to this tool.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"completed-migration-to-generator-2.0\">Completed migration to generator 2.0<\/h4>\n<p>BridgePoint model compilers have incrementally moved to the python-based generator 2.0 (pyrsl) over the<br \/>\nprevious releases. This release completes the migration with updates to the Java model compiler used to<br \/>\nbuild BridgePoint itself.<\/p>\n<p>With this change there is no longer a requirement to downgrade generator to build BridgePoint. This improves<br \/>\nthe experience for BridgePoint developers and keeps full self-hosted development and build in place.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"user-interface\">User Interface<\/h2>\n<h4 id=\"visual-cues-and-improvements\">Visual cues and improvements<\/h4>\n<p>Two enhancements have been made to the xtUML Editor based on user requests. First, class-based operations<br \/>\nare now shown with an underline on the class diagram. Instance-based operations are shown without underlining.<\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" alt='cbo-300x191-8181368' class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1086\" src='https:\/\/onefact.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/cbo-300x191-8181368.png' alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Second, the separator for ranges on UDTs is changed from <code>,<\/code> to <code>..<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p><img alt='range-300x229-3876156' class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1087\" src='https:\/\/onefact.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/range-300x229-3876156.png' alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\" \/><\/p>\n<h4 id=\"oal-editor-automatic-indentation\">OAL editor automatic indentation<\/h4>\n<p>The OAL editor now performs automatic indentation of the next line when the user creates<br \/>\na conditional block or a loop. Specifically, an additional level of indentation to the current line<br \/>\nis automatically inserted when the user hits &#8220;enter\/return&#8221; at the end of a line that contains<br \/>\n<code>if<\/code>, <code>elif<\/code>, <code>else<\/code>, <code>for each<\/code>, or <code>while<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>All indentation (automatic or manual) is fixed to properly indent with spaces or tabs using the<br \/>\nuser-specified settings for tab width and &#8220;Insert spaces for tabs&#8221;. These settings are configured<br \/>\nin the BridgePoint preferences at <code>General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"other-ui-enhancements-and-fixes\">Other UI enhancements and fixes<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix to xtUML eXecute Application launch configurations to allow an initializer interface message to run at startup<\/li>\n<li>Fix OAL completion suggestions for constants<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"model-compiler\">Model Compiler<\/h2>\n<h4 id=\"mc-3020-enhancements\">MC-3020 enhancements<\/h4>\n<p><strong>State Save<\/strong> &#8211; A state save contains encoded information representing the current_state of each<br \/>\nrunning state machine in the model as well as the sequences of events on the event queues. A marking<br \/>\nis supplied to enable and configure the state save feature. State Save is accessed in application<br \/>\nmodels via an External Entity with bridges to trigger state save and read previously saved state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simulated Time<\/strong> &#8211; Simulated Time in MC-3020 implements a form of discrete event simulation. In simulated<br \/>\ntime mode, no external clock is read. The application runs as fast as the architecture allows. The time<br \/>\nbase is derived from timers used to cause functional delays in the production application.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class-specific Tracing<\/strong> &#8211; Functionality is added in MC-3020 for classes to trace state machine state<br \/>\ntransitions and to trace individual action language statements. A mechanism is provided to enable or disable<br \/>\nthis tracing functionality on a class by class basis. A marking is supplied to identify which classes are<br \/>\nincluded in or excluded from tracing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Persistence<\/strong> &#8211; Add the ability to persist instance data so that it survives across power cycles<br \/>\n(down and up). The instances that are present when power is removed are automatically restored when<br \/>\npower returns. Links between persistent instances are also saved and restored to and from non-volatile<br \/>\nstorage (NVS).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keyed Timers<\/strong> &#8211; Keyed timers have been an undocumented feature for several years. This work makes<br \/>\nkeyed timers the default implementation generated by the model compilers. Keyed timers prevent the<br \/>\naccidental reuse of an expired timer and prevent one part of the application from canceling a timer<br \/>\nstarted by another part of the application. It does this by assigning a unique access key. The access<br \/>\nkey is carried by the owner (who started the timer) and is passed in to gain access to the timer methods.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"other-mc-enhancements-and-fixes\">Other MC enhancements and fixes<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates for referential attribute processing for reflexive associations<\/li>\n<li>Use mcmc.exe on Windows<\/li>\n<li>Tag interface messages as safe for interrupts.<\/li>\n<li>Fix batch relate to handle string instance identifiers<\/li>\n<li>Updates for polymorphic event handling when sent to self within subtype<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BridgePoint Pro v6.16 One Fact is pleased to announce the release of BridgePoint Pro v6.16.
