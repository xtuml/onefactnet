This method was created by Sally Shlaer and Steve Mellor in the late 80s. It focuses on first modeling data in classes and associations between classes, then modeling behavior in states, events, and transitions, and finally modeling actions in a textual language.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>BridgePoint is an open source tool based on eclipse that allows users to edit xtUML models. It also includes Verifier, which allows users to interpretively execute models and a set of model compilers that generate code from a model to a chosen architecture\/language.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>xtUML itself is modeled using xtUML (this is referred to commonly as the meta-model or the OOAofOOA). The editor creates instances of the classes in this model to build application models. Model compilers can query this model to generate code. For example, a model compiler can ask for all the instances of class <em>Attribute<\/em>, and generate a line of Java code for a member in a Java class.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Historically, model compilers have been written in a template language called RSL. RSL queries the meta-model instances and generates code based on the attributes and relationships of those instances. This is an effective way to generate code, but it is slow for large models because it is interpreted.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The main compiler we use (MC3020) generates C code. A handful of years ago, a new partial compiler called <em>mcmc<\/em> was introduced based on MC320. This compiler is actually compiled with BridgePoint (more levels of meta!) and it is very fast, but it only compiles the action language portion of the xtUML model (textual language). Overall it decreases the build time for a large model significantly (order of 10 in some cases).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We have another compiler called MC-Java which is used to compile BridgePoint to Java plugins for eclipse. It is quite old and messy and cannot be used for generic Java. There are a lot of problems with MC-Java, but one we can solve now is to extend mcmc to also translate action language to Java. We can integrate this with MC-Java and it should cut our build time down significantly for BridgePoint. This is very desirable right now because a full build of our tool can take almost an hour. This project will greatly help our developers.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If you have any more questions about how this works, let me know.
