Data format changes, incompatibilities or weak conversion result in orphaned IP. On the other hand, a connected, contiguous and smooth transition brings this IP forward preserving its inate value as well as leveraging its value to test the upgrade step just taken.<\/p>\n<p>xtUML is characterized by (interpretive) model execution and behavior-preserving model translation. Since xtUML models are translatable, they can be translated &#8220;forward&#8221; along carefully chosen steps of an\u00a0&#8220;incremental, never broken&#8221;\u00a0path.<\/p>\n<p>The future of xtUML (and BridgePoint technology) is along a path of open source, open standards and an active community ecosystem. The trick is navigating this path without losing the valuable intellectual property contained in hundreds of existing projects and applications. Thus, the path forward will be incremental, always advancing, never broken.<\/p>\n<p>Watch\u00a0the xtUML roadmap unfold along\u00a0a path\u00a0from OSS BridgePoint today to Papyrus xtUML tomorrow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Often there are two ways to get from point A to point B, step by step or all at once.
