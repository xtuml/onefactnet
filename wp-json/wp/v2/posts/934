CPS exhibit complex and unpredictable behaviors, thus making their correctness and robustness analysis a challenging task. In order to address their full complexity, there is an emergent need for formal, yet efficient and scalable methods for the verification and analysis of CPS. Light-weight verification techniques, such as monitoring and testing, achieve both rigour and efficiency by enabling the evaluation of systems according to the properties of their individual behaviours. The Monitoring and Testing of Cyber-Physical Systems (MT-CPS) workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners interested in the problems of detecting, testing, measuring and extracting qualitative and quantitative properties from CPS behaviors. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br \/>\n&#8211; Specification languages for monitoring and testing<br \/>\n&#8211; Runtime verification and monitoring of CPS<br \/>\n&#8211; Testing the integration of heterogeneous components<br \/>\n&#8211; Interpretation of multi-dimensional counter-examples<br \/>\n&#8211; Black-box and white-box testing<br \/>\n&#8211; Measuring and statistical information gathering<br \/>\n&#8211; Simulation-based verification and parameter synthesis<br \/>\n&#8211; Diagnostics, error localization and repair<br \/>\n&#8211; Combination of static and dynamic analysis<br \/>\n&#8211; Applications and case studies, including in medical platforms<\/p>\n<p>Workshop Format<br \/>\nMT CPS workshop is intended to be a forum for exchanging the latest scientific trends between researchers and practitioners interested in the field of light-weight verification and analysis of CPS. As a consequence, the workshop will NOT have formal proceedings. We encourage submission of abstracts that address any of the aforementioned topics of interest and cover recently published results as well as the work in progress.<br \/>\nImportant Dates<br \/>\nAbstract submission deadline:\u00a0<span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_256075220\"><span class=\"aQJ\">February 20<\/span><\/span><br \/>\nNotification: March<br \/>\nEarly registration: TBD<br \/>\nWorkshop:\u00a0<span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_256075221\"><span class=\"aQJ\">April 10, 2018<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Program Chairs<br \/>\nHoussam Abbas, University of Pennsylvania<br \/>\nThao Dang, Verimag<br \/>\nBardh Hoxha, Souther Illinois University<br \/>\nTakashi Ichimasa, Mentor Graphics, USA<\/p>\n<p>Program Committee<br \/>\nHoussam Abbas, University of Pennsylvania, USA<br \/>\nEzio Bartocci, Vienna University of Technology, Austria<br \/>\nMauricio Castillo-Effen, General Electric<br \/>\nThao Dang, VERIMAG, France<br \/>\nJyotirmoy Deshmukh, University of Souther California<br \/>\nGeorgios Fainekos, Arizona State University, USA<br \/>\nSebastian Fischmeister, University of Waterloo, Canada<br \/>\nIchiro Hasuo, University of Tokyo, Japan<br \/>\nBardh Hoxha, Souther Illinois University<br \/>\nTakashi Ichimasa, Mentor Graphics, USA<br \/>\nBaekGyu Kim, Toyota InfoTechnology Center, USA<br \/>\nOded Maler, VERIMAG, France<br \/>\nMohammad Reza Mousavi, Halmstad University<br \/>\nJens Oehlerking, Robert Bosch GmbH<br \/>\nOleg Sokolsky, University of Pennsylvania, USA<br \/>\nCortland Starrett, OneFact, USA<br \/>\nQiming Zhao, Denso<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MT-CPS&#8217;18 3d International Workshop on Monitoring and Testing of Cyber-Physical Systems Porto, Portugal, USA 10 April 2018 Co-located with CPS Week https:\/\/sites.google.com\/asu.edu\/mtcps2018 DESCRIPTION Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are integrations of heterogeneous collaborative entities that interact among themselves and with their physical environment.
